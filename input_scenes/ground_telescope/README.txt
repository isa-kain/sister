Sky model README
the ESO sky model is a product of a theoretical calculation cross calibrated with thousands of spectra. 
The files here are based on online version release 2.0.6
based on the papers Noll et al. (2012, A&A 543, A92) and Jones et al. (2013, A&A 560, A91). 
This version does not yet include the most recent minor revision of the
Aerosol extinction curve by Jones et al 2019.

The files here are intended as internal reference model for 
the starshader + ELTs project
