% Pupil. Ideal if it is spinning, including the secondary and struts. Struts are considered in a simple way in this case: the blocked area of the pupil is a secondary with equivalent area as the secondary+struts. See get_default_options.m when setting opt.secondary for details.
% If it is non-spinning, it uses input_scenes/pupil_D1Kpix_256.fits which is for WFIRST including secondary and struts in the optical model and when computing the collecting area.
